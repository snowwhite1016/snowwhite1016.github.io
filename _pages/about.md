I am Luo Xuewen, a dedicated postgraduate student currently pursuing a Master of Artificial Intelligence at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu.my/) now, with a solid foundation in Logistics Management from [Yunnan University](http://english.ynu.edu.cn/). My academic journey is highlighted by a commitment to excellence, as evidenced by my Bachelor's degree, where I delved into diverse subjects ranging from Principles of Economics to Information Systems for Supply Chain Managementï¼Œwith courses like Python and data science lay the groundwork for my current AI endeavors.

My current research interests are about Autonomous Driving and Intelligent Transportation Systems, particularly in applying artificial intelligence technologies, especially multimodal and natural language processing large models, to them. I aim to explore how to improve and apply AI large models, especially for perception-understanding and reasoning-decision ablility and moral and legal security, can enhance the performance and safety of autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic systems.
